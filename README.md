working with data and code A2 

Project Type: TunePad musical composition 
- Remix version of the song Freed From Desire

TunePad was the coding platform and Python language was used. TunePad also allowed there to be different musical cells for each instrument where i was able to split each section up into the melody, percussion and chords. This also alloweed me to add my own creative flare to the muscial composition. 

YouTube was also a major asset which helped with the muscial composition of the song where i used a video showing the song being played on the piano to help build my melody. The link for the YouTube video is below:

To run or hear the TunePad project you need to import the .json file back into TunePad:
1. download json. file from github
2. go to tunepad
3. log in
4. click projects
5. click import project
5. Upload the jdon. file you downloaded from github
6. tunepad will then create the project
7. you can now run the project 

In terms of running the code it is quite straight forward where in the top right hand corner of TunePad there is a play button which will run all the code simultaneously. If you wish to listen to each instrument individually this can also be done by individually picking which cell you want to run either on the right hand side where all the cells are lined up or scrolling to see the code and pressing play on the individual cell.
